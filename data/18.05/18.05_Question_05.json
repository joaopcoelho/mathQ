       "Original question": "A bag contains 12 cards in the shape of geometrically equal rectangles: 3 blue, 2 white, 3 black and 4 red. The 12 cards will be removed, successively and at random, from the bag and placed on a table, lined up in the order in which they are removed. Find the probability that the blue cards are all together. Express the result as an irreducible fraction.",

       "Codex code explanation": "1. We start by initializing the variables both_girls, older_girl, and either_girl to 0.\n2. We then simulate 10,000 families, and for each family we simulate two children.\n3. If the older child is a girl, we increment older_girl.\n4. If both children are girls, we increment both_girls.\n5. If at least one of the children is a girl, we increment either_girl.\n6. Finally, we compute the probabilities we are interested in.",
