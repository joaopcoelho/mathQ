       "Codex code explanation": "1. We start by initializing the variables both_girls, older_girl, and either_girl to 0.\n2. We then simulate 10,000 families, and for each family we simulate two children.\n3. If the older child is a girl, we increment older_girl.\n4. If both children are girls, we increment both_girls.\n5. If at least one of the children is a girl, we increment either_girl.\n6. Finally, we compute the probabilities we are interested in.",
