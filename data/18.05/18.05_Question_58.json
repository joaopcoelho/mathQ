It returns a list of the averages of the two dice rolls.\n\n3. def standard_deviation(nums):\n    mean = sum(nums) / len(nums)\n    squared_diffs = [(num - mean) ** 2 for num in nums]\n    return (sum(squared_diffs) / len(nums)) ** 0.5\n\nThis function takes in a list of numbers and returns the standard deviation of those numbers.\n\n4. print(standard_deviation(simulate_rolls(4, 6, 100000)))\n\nThis line prints the standard deviation of the averages of the two dice rolls.\n",
