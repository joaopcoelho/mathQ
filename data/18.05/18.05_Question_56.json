       "Codex code explanation": "1. It's defining a function called roll_die() that returns a random integer between 1 and 4.\n2. It's defining a function called roll_die_100000_times() that returns a list of 100000 random integers between 1 and 4.\n3. It's defining a function called standard_deviation() that returns the standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n4. It's defining a function called main() that prints the standard deviation of the list of 100000 random integers between 1 and 4.\n5. It's calling the main() function.",
