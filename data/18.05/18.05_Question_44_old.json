       "Codex code explanation": "1. We start by initializing the variables both_girls, older_girl, and either_girl to 0.\n2. We then loop 10000 times, each time randomly choosing a kid to be older and another to be younger.\n3. If the older kid is a girl, we increment older_girl.\n4. If both kids are girls, we increment both_girls.\n5. If at least one of the kids is a girl, we increment either_girl.\n6. Finally, we print the probabilities of both kids being girls given that the older kid is a girl, and given that at least one kid is a girl.",
