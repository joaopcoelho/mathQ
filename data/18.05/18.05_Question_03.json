       "Original question": "Consider that the initial constitution of the bag has changed and that, in this bag, there are now eight blue balls and seven white balls. The intention is to place all these balls in ten boxes numbered from 1 to 10, in such a way that: each box with an even number has at least one blue ball; each odd-numbered box has at least one white ball; Each box has a maximum of two balls. Under these conditions, how many different ways can the balls be placed in the ten boxes?",
