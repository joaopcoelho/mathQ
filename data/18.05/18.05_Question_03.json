       "Original question": "A bag contains blue balls and white balls, indistinguishable by touch. Each ball has a single color and there are only blue balls and white balls in the bag. There are eight blue balls and seven white balls in the bag. The intention is to place all these balls in ten boxes numbered from 1 to 10, in such a way that: each box with an even number has at least one blue ball; each odd-numbered box has at least one white ball; and each box has a maximum of two balls. Under these conditions, how many different ways can the balls be placed in the ten boxes?",
